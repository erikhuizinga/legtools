The `img` branch is for storage of the images referred to in [Readme.md](https://github.com/erikhuizinga/legtools/blob/master/Readme.md) on the [`master`](https://github.com/erikhuizinga/legtools/tree/master) branch. They are not included in that branch to decrease its download size, i.e., when you grab a copy of the `master` branch or a release (which is a tag on the `master` branch).
